<h3>WHAT IS BENEXT ?</h3>

<p>
You must have experienced waiting in line for one hour or more. To enter a
museum, for instance, or to get to the desk of a public office. For some people
these waits are rare occurrences, for others they are the norm. But surely, they
are never pleasant and avoiding them would save us time and give us less stressful
days.
<br />
That is why I designed <span class="benextName"></span>, a queue management system which, thanks to
last-minute booking method, shrinks hours long lines into five minutes ones.

</p>

<p>
This extraordinary reduction is made possible by a simple device:
the <span class="benextName"></span> terminal.
<br />
Placed at the entrance of those facilities subject to the formation of a
queue, the terminal controls users' access imposing an admittance protocol.
Following it, users allow the terminal to organize the line in order to shrink
waiting times.

<p>
If it sounds difficult do not worry: ease of use has been the top priority
in designing <span class="benextName"></span>.
The system in fact aims to become a replacement for the traditional line.
Therefore it must be equally simple and straightforward, since everyone has to be
able to to use it, the child as well as the elder.
<br />
Furthermore, for <span class="benextName"></span> to be universally accessible, it's fundamental for
it to be bereft of user requirements. One can even be unaware of what <span class="benextName"></span> is,
yet he will be able to use it and take advantage of the benefits it offers.

<p>
I will now explain in greater detail how <span class="benextName"></span> works and how you would utilize it,
examining three common situations in which it allows avoiding a long wait.
