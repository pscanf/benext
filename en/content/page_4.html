<h3>THE APP</h3>

<p>
In the two previous situations the user, in order to book for a place in line,
had to physically go to the terminal and press the button or pass the badge.
However, booking is an action that can easily be performed remotely using, for
instance, a smartphone.
Therefore, <span class="benextName"></span> offers this possibility with an app
and a website through which you can book yourself into every line managed by the system.
Let me demonstrate you, once again with an example, the simple procedure necessary to
access a queue using the app.

Let's go back to our friend Paul visiting the historic city. After buying the badge
Paul takes off his smartphone, launches the <span class="benextName"></span> app
and scans the QR code on the badge. The app adds him to the tourists network of
that city enabling him to book for a place into any line served by <span class="benextName"></span>.
</p>

<p>
Once booked for an attraction, the app shows the time interval in which Paul
must return to gain access. For that, he has to simply pass
his badge in front of the terminal, as he would have done in the previous
situation. Alternatively, he can launch the app and scan a QR code that
appears on the terminal. From the app a confirmation code will be sent through
the internet to the terminal, which will allow Paul in.

Paul can even skip buying the badge. In fact, the app allows him to purchase the
ticket directly. Thus he can now buy, book and access attractions with his smartphone,
and the stressful, hours long waits are replaced by a handful of touches.
