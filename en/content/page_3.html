<h3>THE BADGE</h3>

<p>
If the ticket office example convinced you about the convenience and simplicity
of <span class="benextName"></span>, let me show you how it can result, in
certain situations, even more useful, expeditious and straightforward.
</p>

<p>
Let's now take into consideration the reality of a historic city rich of
museums, palaces, parks and, most of all, full of tourists.
Here long waits are a daily habit. Masses of visitors wait hours at the
entrances of the big touristic attractions in unorganized, interminable lines.
To mitigate the formation of those lines and offer tourists a better experience,
the city has decided to adopt <span class="benextName"></span>.
</p>

<p>
The implementation deployed in this context is an extension of the one seen in
the previous example. At the entrance of each cultural attraction a <span class="benextName"></span>
terminal is installed. These terminals regulate the entry to the establishments,
mandating the access protocol seen before through which the tourist can arrive
at the place of interest, press the button on the terminal, pick up the
ticket, return at the time written on the ticket and gain access to the short
queue.

Moreover the visitor has the possibility of buying a badge which allows him to
book himself into any of the establishments served by
<span class="benextName"></span>. Let me show you how.
</p>

<p>
Paul is now in the shoes of the tourist, and he scheduled visiting a handful of
museums and palaces in our hypothetical city.
Once arrived in the city he enters the nearest bookstall and asks the retailer for a
<span class="benextName"></span> badge. The seller hands him the small plastic rectangle which costs - say
- 5 euros, and informs him that the price of the badge will be deducted from the
entry fee of the first attraction he visits.
</p>

<p>
Paul now walks towards the first museum on his list, in front of
which he finds the familiar <span class="benextName"></span> terminal. Instead of pressing the button,
Paul passes his badge in front of the device which registers the booking and
prints a ticket indicating the interval at which he must
return to gain entry.
This time there isn't any QR code on the ticket, which serves only as a
reminder. In fact, the user is identified by the QR code imprinted on the badge.
</p>

<p>
At the time written on the ticket Paul goes back to the museum, passes his badge
in front of the terminal and gets in. After a 5-minute line for the desk, Paul
buys the entry for the museum, obtaining the 5 euros deduction he was due.
Without <span class="benextName"></span> he would have
had to stand in line for at least one hour and a half.
