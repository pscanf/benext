<h3>THE TICKET</h3>

<p>
Let's consider the ticket office of a big city's railway station. I will
demonstrate with an example how <span class="benextName"></span> can be used in this context.
</p>

<p>
Paul, the user, has to collect a refund from the railways. He hence heads to the
aforesaid office, a notoriously crowded place, with waiting times ranging from
twenty minutes to one hour and a half. Suppose Paul arrives at the station at
noon and finds a forty-five minute wait to get to the desk.
</p>

<p>
Traditionally, a physical line would form which Paul must join and which would
take him, after 45 minutes of slow progress, to the front. At 12.45 that is.
However, the station has adopted <span class="benextName"></span>. At the
entrance of the station, Paul thus finds the terminal we've seen before,
equipped with instructions that read:

<img id="shortLine1" src="images/png/shortLine1.png" />
<ol>
	<li><p>Press the button</p></li>
	<li><p>Collect the ticket</p></li>
	<li><p>Come back at the indicated time </p></li>
	<li><p>Pass the ticket in front of the terminal
		<br /><br />(you will hear a confirmation sound)</p></li>
	<li><p>Join the line</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<br />

<p>
Having read the sign, Paul presses the button and takes the ticket issued by the
terminal, on which are printed a QR code and an indication:
</p>

<p id="ticketIndication">"Come back between 12.40 and 12.50".</p>

<p>
The terminal has now registered the user's booking. He will be identified by
the QR code on the ticket. Paul is now free to leave the station and he decides to
spend those 40/50 minutes to have lunch in a nearby cafe.
</p>
<br />

Between 12.40 adn 12.50 Paul returns to the ticket office's entrance, he
passes his <span class="benextName"></span> ticket in front of the terminal
and gets admitted to a 5-minute line for the desk, which he will reach at 12.45.
<br />
The clear advantage is that he didn't have to wait in line the whole time.
He could, as he did, wander off without worrying, because <span class="benextName"></span>
guaranteed getting him to the desk in five minutes at his return.
