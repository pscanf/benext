<h3>INDIEGOGO</h3>

<p>
<span class="benextName"></span> is a project carried on by a one-man company.
I - funder and developer - work full time trying to bring it to life.
</p>

<p>
However, like all projects in production, <span class="benextName"></span> does not generate any revenue and I am
therefore raising funds which will allow me to complete it as soon as possible.
I hence decided to turn to <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/"
target="blank">indiegogo</a>,
a crowd-funding platform which allows everyone to sponsor small projects like
mine through donations.
</p>

<p>
Raised funds will be used for:
<ul>
	<li>
	realizing a working prototype of a <span class="benextName"></span> terminal
	</li>
	<li>
	hire professionals needed to work on the non-coding related parts of <span class="benextName"></span>,
	such as a designer, an UX-specialist, a hardware engineer.
	</li>
	<li>
	cover the expenses for promoting the product (once completed)
	</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If what <span class="benextName"></span> offers piqued your interest and you'd like to be able to take
advantage of the benefits, you can help me bring it to life by contributing
a small sum <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/benext" target="blank">at the homepage
of the project</a> on indiegogo.
