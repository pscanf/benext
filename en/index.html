				<h3>WHAT IS BENEXT ?</h3>

<p>
You must have experienced waiting in line for one hour or more. To enter a
museum, for instance, or to get to the desk of a public office. For some people
these waits are rare occurrences, for others they are the norm. But surely, they
are never pleasant and avoiding them would save us time and give us less stressful
days.
<br />
That is why I designed <span class="benextName"></span>, a queue management system which, thanks to
last-minute booking method, shrinks hours long lines into five minutes ones.
<img id="terminal" src="images/png/terminal.png" />
</p>

<p>
This extraordinary reduction is made possible by a simple device:
the <span class="benextName"></span> terminal.
<br />
Placed at the entrance of those facilities subject to the formation of a
queue, the terminal controls users' access imposing an admittance protocol.
Following it, users allow the terminal to organize the line in order to shrink
waiting times.
</p>

<p>
If it sounds difficult do not worry: ease of use has been the top priority
in designing <span class="benextName"></span>.
The system in fact aims to become a replacement for the traditional line.
Therefore it must be equally simple and straightforward, since everyone has to be
able to to use it, the child as well as the elder.
<br />
Furthermore, for <span class="benextName"></span> to be universally accessible, it's fundamental for
it to be bereft of user requirements. One can even be unaware of what <span class="benextName"></span> is,
yet he will be able to use it and take advantage of the benefits it offers.
</p>

<p>
I will now explain in greater detail how <span class="benextName"></span> works and how you would utilize it,
examining three common situations in which it allows avoiding a long wait.
</p>

<img class="nextArrow" src="images/png/nextBlue.png" />

			<div id="page2" class="page">
				<h3>THE TICKET</h3>

<p>
Let's consider the ticket office of a big city's railway station. I will
demonstrate with an example how <span class="benextName"></span> can be used in this context.
</p>

<p>
Paul, the user, has to collect a refund from the railways. He hence heads to the
aforesaid office, a notoriously crowded place, with waiting times ranging from
twenty minutes to one hour and a half. Suppose Paul arrives at the station at
noon and finds a forty-five minute wait to get to the desk.
</p>

<p>
Traditionally, a physical line would form which Paul must join and which would
take him, after 45 minutes of slow progress, to the front. At 12.45 that is.
However, the station has adopted <span class="benextName"></span>. At the
entrance of the station, Paul thus finds the terminal we've seen before,
equipped with instructions that read:

<img id="shortLine1" src="images/png/shortLine1.png" />
<ol>
	<li><p>Press the button</p></li>
	<li><p>Collect the ticket</p></li>
	<li><p>Come back at the indicated time </p></li>
	<li><p>Pass the ticket in front of the terminal
		<br /><br />(you will hear a confirmation sound)</p></li>
	<li><p>Join the line</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<br />

<img id="ticket" src="images/png/ticket.png" />
<p>
Having read the sign, Paul presses the button and takes the ticket issued by the
terminal, on which are printed a QR code and an indication:
</p>

<p id="ticketIndication">"Come back between 12.40 and 12.50".</p>

<p>
The terminal has now registered the user's booking. He will be identified by
the QR code on the ticket. Paul is now free to leave the station and he decides to
spend those 40/50 minutes to have lunch in a nearby cafe.
</p>
<br />

<p>
<img id="shortLine2" src="images/png/shortLine2.png" />
Between 12.40 adn 12.50 Paul returns to the ticket office's entrance, he
passes his <span class="benextName"></span> ticket in front of the terminal
and gets admitted to a 5-minute line for the desk, which he will reach at 12.45.
<br />
The clear advantage is that he didn't have to wait in line the whole time.
He could, as he did, wander off without worrying, because <span class="benextName"></span>
guaranteed getting him to the desk in five minutes at his return.
</p>

				<h3>THE BADGE</h3>

<p>
If the ticket office example convinced you about the convenience and simplicity
of <span class="benextName"></span>, let me show you how it can result, in
certain situations, even more useful, expeditious and straightforward.
</p>

<p>
Let's now take into consideration the reality of a historic city rich of
museums, palaces, parks and, most of all, full of tourists.
Here long waits are a daily habit. Masses of visitors wait hours at the
entrances of the big touristic attractions in unorganized, interminable lines.
To mitigate the formation of those lines and offer tourists a better experience,
the city has decided to adopt <span class="benextName"></span>.
</p>

<p>
The implementation deployed in this context is an extension of the one seen in
the previous example. At the entrance of each cultural attraction a <span class="benextName"></span>
terminal is installed. These terminals regulate the entry to the establishments,
mandating the access protocol seen before through which the tourist can arrive
at the place of interest, press the button on the terminal, pick up the
ticket, return at the time written on the ticket and gain access to the short
queue.
</p>

<p>
<img id="badge" src="images/png/badge.png" />
Moreover the visitor has the possibility of buying a badge which allows him to
book himself into any of the establishments served by
<span class="benextName"></span>. Let me show you how.
</p>

<p>
Paul is now in the shoes of the tourist, and he scheduled visiting a handful of
museums and palaces in our hypothetical city.
Once arrived in the city he enters the nearest bookstall and asks the retailer for a
<span class="benextName"></span> badge. The seller hands him the small plastic rectangle which costs - say
- 5 euros, and informs him that the price of the badge will be deducted from the
entry fee of the first attraction he visits.
</p>

<p>
Paul now walks towards the first museum on his list, in front of
which he finds the familiar <span class="benextName"></span> terminal. Instead of pressing the button,
Paul passes his badge in front of the device which registers the booking and
prints a ticket indicating the interval at which he must
return to gain entry.
This time there isn't any QR code on the ticket, which serves only as a
reminder. In fact, the user is identified by the QR code imprinted on the badge.
</p>

<p>
At the time written on the ticket Paul goes back to the museum, passes his badge
in front of the terminal and gets in. After a 5-minute line for the desk, Paul
buys the entry for the museum, obtaining the 5 euros deduction he was due.
Without <span class="benextName"></span> he would have
had to stand in line for at least one hour and a half.
</p>

<img class="nextArrow" src="images/png/nextBlue.png" />

			<div id="page4" class="page">
				<h3>THE APP</h3>

<p>
In the two previous situations the user, in order to book for a place in line,
had to physically go to the terminal and press the button or pass the badge.
However, booking is an action that can easily be performed remotely using, for
instance, a smartphone.
Therefore, <span class="benextName"></span> offers this possibility with an app
and a website through which you can book yourself into every line managed by the system.
Let me demonstrate you, once again with an example, the simple procedure necessary to
access a queue using the app.
</p>

<p>
<img id="appScreen" src="images/png/appScreen.png" />
Let's go back to our friend Paul visiting the historic city. After buying the badge
Paul takes off his smartphone, launches the <span class="benextName"></span> app
and scans the QR code on the badge. The app adds him to the tourists network of
that city enabling him to book for a place into any line served by <span class="benextName"></span>.
</p>

<p>
Once booked for an attraction, the app shows the time interval in which Paul
must return to gain access. For that, he has to simply pass
his badge in front of the terminal, as he would have done in the previous
situation. Alternatively, he can launch the app and scan a QR code that
appears on the terminal. From the app a confirmation code will be sent through
the internet to the terminal, which will allow Paul in.
</p>

<p>
Paul can even skip buying the badge. In fact, the app allows him to purchase the
ticket directly. Thus he can now buy, book and access attractions with his smartphone,
and the stressful, hours long waits are replaced by a handful of touches.

				<h3>INDIEGOGO</h3>

<p>
<span class="benextName"></span> is a project carried on by a one-man company.
I - funder and developer - work full time trying to bring it to life.
</p>

<p>
However, like all projects in production, <span class="benextName"></span> does not generate any revenue and I am
therefore raising funds which will allow me to complete it as soon as possible.
I hence decided to turn to <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/"
target="blank">indiegogo</a>,
a crowd-funding platform which allows everyone to sponsor small projects like
mine through donations.
</p>

<p>
Raised funds will be used for:
<ul>
	<li>
	realizing a working prototype of a <span class="benextName"></span> terminal
	</li>
	<li>
	hire professionals needed to work on the non-coding related parts of <span class="benextName"></span>,
	such as a designer, an UX-specialist, a hardware engineer.
	</li>
	<li>
	cover the expenses for promoting the product (once completed)
	</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If what <span class="benextName"></span> offers piqued your interest and you'd like to be able to take

	<h4>QUESTION</h4>
	<p>
		<b>Will <span class="benextName"></span> support
		non-physical things like over-the-phone support queues?</b>
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm working on my own startup, and someday that will mean
		handling an understaffed phone support system - sounds like
		the sort of thing <span class="benextName"></span> could make a
		lot less stressful for callers and support staff alike, provided
		that it's designed with that as a potential usage.
	</p>
	<div class="rightAligned">
		<span class="contractExpand">shrink</span>
	</div>
	<h4>ANSWER</h4>
<p>
I haven't really thought about that possibility, but I guess the system could be easily adapted for those. Usually call centers who adopt a queue management system chose the one in which the customer leaves his phone number and he gets called back, but actually <span class="benextName"></span> could be used as well. When the costumer calls, an answering machine gives him - say - a 4 digit number and tells him to call back in x-minutes. When he calls back, he inputs the number and if it matches he waits for a bit and then he starts speaking with the support center.
</p>
<p>
However, <span class="benextName"></span> works best with very long lines. In simple terms, this is how it works: to calculate after how many minutes the costumer needs to call/come back, <span class="benextName"></span> considers the average time needed for a customer, and multiplies for the number of costumers currently in line. So if a costumer has a very long call with the support center, and there is only one person who answers the phone, this could "unbalance" the system, and the costumers after will have to wait more. This is not a problem for very busy places like museums or ticket offices, because multiple costumers can be served simultaneously, so the situation in which a user blocks the line for everybody cannot verify. I've built some mechanisms that allow managing line-blocking users even in small lines, but ultimately this remains <span class="benextName"></span>'s Achilles' heel (or better, in those situations <span class="benextName"></span> can only help marginally, and maybe some other system can be used).
<br />
Moreover, when the user calls back, he may still need to wait a bit on the phone, something he may not like (certainly if the alternative is making him wait 30/40 minutes on the phone, <span class="benextName"></span> offers still a big improvement).
You could go around these two issues by increasing the time-per-costumer, which would guarantee that when the costumer calls back he doesn't have to wait, although you would decrease the number of costumers you can serve each day.
</p>
<p>
It would also be a bit tricky, as I see it, to explain on the phone to the caller what he needs to do (taking the number, calling back after some time, entering the number on the numpad...).
</p>
<p>
So, to return to the call center scenario. Yes, I guess <span class="benextName"></span> could be used in a call center, but there might be better solutions.
Moreover, right now I don't feel like making any plan for supporting that usage, as it is very particular, in the sense that I would probably have to integrate the functionality of a <span class="benextName"></span> terminal into a PBX (and there are many PBXs out there, so I would have to commit to a particular one). But it's nothing too difficult, the engine of <span class="benextName"></span> could be still used, since the project is open source. So hiring a developer to build the PBX-integration would be fairly easy. Still, before doing that I would look into other possibilities to solve the call center problem.
